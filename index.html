<h2>Lesson 1 Notes:-</h2>
<div class="lesson">
	<h3>Basics:-</h3>
  	<p>
  		We use a language called HTML to write web pages. HTML stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em>.
    	<br>

		We use a protocol called HTTP to transfer web pages to our browser. HTTP stands for <em>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</em>
    	<br>
		The WWW <em>(World Wide Web)</em> was invented in 1990 and has around 30 Billion pages
	</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson"> 
<h3>Some HTML we learned about:-</h3>
   	<p>
    	<em>Anchors</em>:- Used to insert links into web pages
    	<br>
    	<em>Void Tags</em>:- A tag with no closing tag such as "br"
    	<br>
    	<em>Inline tags</em>:- Tags that are displayed "inline" on the web page, such as "em" and "span"
    	<br>
    	<em>Block tags</em>:- Tags that have a shape that forms a box around the content, such as "p" and "div"
    </p>
 </div>

<div class="lesson">
<h3> Some Examples:-</h3>
	<p>	
		This is written with a div tag. It adds a break (new line) at the end, it's a block tag
		We can also use a span tag. There is no new line added at the end of this tag, it's an inline tag
	</p>

	<p>
		This is an example of an <a href="http://www.att.com">anchor</a> link
	</p>

<h2>Lesson 2 Notes:-</h2>
  <div class="lesson">
  		<p>
  			Front End Web Development is all about boxes. Even circles are boxes!
			We learned how to use the developer tools in Chrome to analyze the style of the elements and to see the tree structure
		</p>

  		<p> 
  			We are using editors like Sublime Text and scratchpad.io to create our HTML
  		</p>

  		<p> 
  			It's important to use structure in our webpages so they are easy to read and to debug. We need to use indentation to identify the tree structure and to see how elements are nested
  		</p>

<!-- These are the lesson 3 notes -->
<h2>Lesson 3 Notes:-</h2>
  <div class="lesson">
  		<p>
  			CSS is used to control the style of HTML elements. CSS is based on inheritance. This allows us to use CSS to reduce code used when declaring properties of elements. We try and avoid repetition because it saves on code when we reuse, and it's easier to debug.
  			The CSS developer guide is located <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference"> here</a>.
  			CSS format is selector:property:value.
  		</p>  	
  		<p>
  			We can include CSS in 3 ways:-
  		<ul>
   	  		<li>In the head of the HTML</li> 
  	  		<li>Link to a separate CSS file</li> 
  	  		<li>Write style inline with the HTML</li>
  	  	</ul>

  		<p>
  			In CSS code comments begin with /* and end with */
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Each HTML element is a box, and each box has 4 components. We can set the size of the box using pixels, percentage or the box-sizing attribute to border-box
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			When writing CSS use the theory - Code, Test, Refine. 1) Look for natural boxes. 2) Look for repeated styles. 3) Write the HTML. 4) Apply styles from biggest to smallest. 5) Fix things.

  			To verify HTML we use <a href=" http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input"><em>HTML Verify</em></a>
  		</p>
